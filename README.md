# Photo Poet

Photo Poet is a creative web application that uses generative AI to transform your photos into unique works of art. You can synthesize a new image from multiple photos and a description, or simply upload a single image to inspire a custom poem. Bring your creations to life with AI-generated artistic images and audio narration.

## Features

This application showcases several powerful generative AI capabilities:

### 1. AI Image Synthesis

Combine multiple images to create something entirely new.

-   **Upload 2-3 photos** to use as inspiration.
-   **Describe your vision**: Tell the AI what kind of new image to create from the elements of your uploaded photos.
-   The AI synthesizes a **brand-new image** based on your photos and instructions.

### 2. AI-Powered Poem Generation

Generate a unique poem from a single photo or your newly created image.

-   **Use your synthesized image** or **upload a single photo** to serve as the inspiration.
-   **Choose a tone and style** (e.g., Joyful Haiku, Melancholic Sonnet) to guide the AI.
-   The AI analyzes the image and generates a **unique poem** that captures its essence.

### 3. Artistic Image Generation

Transform your poem and its source image into a new piece of visual art.

-   After generating a poem, click the **"Generate Artistic Image"** button.
-   The AI will re-interpret the original photo and the new poem to create a beautiful, painterly image that represents the mood of your poem.

### 4. Poem Revision

Once a poem is created, you can continue to refine it.

-   **Select a new tone** from the dropdown menu (e.g., Romantic, Humorous, Dramatic).
-   Click the "Revise" button, and the AI will **rewrite the poem** in the new style while preserving the original subject matter.

### 5. Text-to-Speech: Read Aloud

Experience your poem in a new way with AI-generated audio.

-   Click the **"Read Aloud"** button.
-   The application uses a text-to-speech model to generate a natural-sounding voice narration of the poem.
-   **Audio playback controls** will appear, allowing you to listen to your poem and download it.
