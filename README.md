# Photo Poet

Photo Poet is a web application that uses generative AI to transform your photos into unique works of art. Upload an image and watch as it inspires a custom poem. You can then bring your creation to life with audio narration and subtle video animation.

## Features

This application showcases several powerful generative AI capabilities:

### 1. AI-Powered Poem Generation

The core feature of the application.

- **Upload any photo** to serve as the inspiration.
- **Choose a tone and style** (e.g., Joyful Haiku, Melancholic Sonnet) to guide the AI.
- The AI analyzes the image and generates a **unique poem** that captures the essence of the photo according to your specifications.

### 2. Poem Revision

Once a poem is created, you can continue to refine it.

- **Select a new tone** from the dropdown menu (e.g., Romantic, Humorous, Dramatic).
- Click the "Revise" button, and the AI will **rewrite the poem** in the new style while preserving the original subject matter.

### 3. Text-to-Speech: Read Aloud

Experience your poem in a new way with AI-generated audio.

- Click the **"Read Aloud"** button.
- The application uses a text-to-speech model to generate a natural-sounding voice narration of the poem.
- **Audio playback controls** will appear, allowing you to listen to your poem.

### 4. Photo Animation & Video Generation

Bring your static photos to life with subtle motion.

- Click the **"Animate Photo"** button.
- An AI video generation model (Veo) creates a short, 5-second video, adding gentle movement to your original image.
- The generated video can be previewed directly in the app and **downloaded as an MP4 file**, perfect for sharing on social media.
